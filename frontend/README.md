# Frontend for Host Your House App

In order to run the front-end independently of the backend,
you must first download the latest version of Node from the official
website at https://nodejs.org/en/

After downloading both Node and npm, do the following:
1. Run `npm install` in order to install all of the dependencies.
2. Run `npm start` in order to start up the front-end application

Once these two steps have been accomplished, users can reach the application
by going to http://localhost:3000 in their browser.
